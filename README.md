# biolink
BioLink is a simple one page BioLink layout that works well on desktops and mobile devices.

-- If you know CSS and PHP you can make adjustments to the code faily easy to adjust colors. --

Currently it has icons for some alternative social media platforms. MeWe, Minds, TruthSocial, Gettr, Parler, USA.life, and Gab.

I plan to add more social networks, started with these since most of the biolink tools out there omit them.

The config.php file has PHP variables that can be easily updated with links to the users social media accounts by replacing 'username' in the URL.

If you need some level of link tracking, this tool is far too basic. However, you could use a selfhosted setup like https://yourls.org/ to create trackable links.
